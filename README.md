# Cigs-By-Breathing
Live in a smoggy city? Figure out how many ciggarettes you smoke by breathing with this.

Just Google the AQI of wherever you live and pass it to this program

Call from a command prompt with `cigs_by_breathing.py` by typing `python cigs_by_breathing.py 134` into your command line and you will get output like

```
0.25 cigs per hour by breathing
1 cig every 4.0 hours
```
